     The session module can not guarantee that the information stored
     in a session is only viewed by the user who created the session.
     Additional measures are needed to protect the confidentiality
     of the session, depending on the value associated with it.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
     The importance of the data carried in the session needs to be
     assessed and further protection may be deployed; this typically
     comes at a price, such as reduced convenience for the user.
     For example, to protect users from a simple social engineering
     tactic, <code class="literal">session.use_only_cookies</code>
     needs to be enabled. In that case, cookies must be enabled
     unconditionally on the client side, or sessions will not work.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
     There are several ways to leak an existing session ID to third
     parties. E.g. JavaScript injections, session IDs in URLs,
     packet sniffing, physical access to the device, etc.
     A leaked session ID enables the third party to access all
     resources associated with a specific ID. First, URLs carrying
     session IDs. If there are links to an external site or resource,
     the URL including the session ID might be stored in the external
     site&#039;s referrer logs. Second, a more active attacker might listen
     to network traffic. If it is unencrypted, session IDs will flow
     in plain text over the network. The solution is to implement
     SSL/TLS on the server and make it mandatory for users.
     HSTS should be used for improved security.
