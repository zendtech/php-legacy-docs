    In this tutorial we assume that your server has activated support 
    for PHP and that all files ending in <var class="filename">.php</var>
    are handled by PHP. On most servers, this is the default extension
    for PHP files, but ask your server administrator to be sure. If
    your server supports PHP, then you do not need to do anything. Just
    create your <var class="filename">.php</var> files, put them in your
    web directory and the server will automatically parse them for you.
    There is no need to compile anything nor do you need to install
    any extra tools. Think of these PHP-enabled files as simple HTML
    files with a whole new family of magical tags that let you do all
    sorts of things.

    Let us say you want to save precious bandwidth and develop locally.  
    In this case, you will want to install a web server, such as 
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;Apache</a>, and of course 
    <a href="https://www.php.net/downloads.php" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PHP</a>. You will most likely 
    want to install a database as well, such as 
    <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;MySQL</a>.

    You can either install these individually or choose a simpler way. Our
    manual has <a href="install.html" class="link">installation instructions for
    PHP</a> (assuming you already have some web server set up). If
    you have problems with installing PHP yourself, we would suggest you ask
    your questions on our <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;installation
    mailing list</a>. If you choose to go on the simpler route, then
    <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMP_packages" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;locate a pre-configured package</a>
    for your operating system,  which automatically installs all of these
    with just a few mouse clicks. It is easy to setup a web server with PHP
    support on any operating system, including MacOSX, Linux and Windows.
    On Linux, you may find <a href="http://www.rpmfind.net/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;rpmfind</a> and
    <a href="http://rpm.pbone.net/" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;PBone</a> helpful for
    locating RPMs. You may also want to visit <a href="https://packages.debian.org/index" class="link external">&raquo;&nbsp;apt-get</a> to find packages for Debian.
