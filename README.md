# PHP Legacy Documentation

This project preserves the documentation for older PHP versions that has been retired from the official [php.net manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en), now published on [php-legacy-docs.zend.com](https://php-legacy-docs.zend.com)

The legacy documentation is maintained by Zend and the community.

## Why Not Just Upgrade?

Ideally, we'd love to see everyone running the latest version of PHP! But to achieve this, someone has to read the old documentation to ensure the application's compatibility with the new PHP version.

## FAQ

__Q: Where are the translations?__

A: There is no plan to maintain translations for legacy documentation.

__Q: Will the documentation be updated?__
